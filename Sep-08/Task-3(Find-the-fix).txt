1). Find The Fix:
    1. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined:-
	* JavaScript TypeError is thrown when an operand or argument passed 
	to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator 
	or function.
	* This error occurs in Chrome Browser when you read a property or call 
	a method on an undefined object.
	
	EXAMPLE:
		function myFunc(inVar) {
  			if (inVar === undefined) {
        			console.log(inVar.not)
  			}
  			return inVar;
			}
		var testVar;
		console.log(myFunc(testVar)); 
    

    2. TypeError: Undefined is not an Object:-
	* This error occurs when a property is accessed or a method is called 
	on an undefined object. This error is shown only on safari browser.
	
	Example:
		var person;
		console.log(person.name);

    
    3. TypeError: Null is not an Object:-
	* This error occurs when you read a property or call a method on a null object.
	* An object is expected somewhere and wasn't provided. So, you will get null is 
	not an object error.
	
	EXAMPLE:
		var vehicle=null:
		console.log(vehicle.model_name);

    4). TypeError: Undefined is not a function:-
  	* This error occurs when attempting to call a value like a function, where the 
	value is not a function.

	EXAMPLE:
		var foo=undefined;
		foo();

    5). Uncaught RangeError: Maximum CallStack Exceeded:-
	* Sometimes calling a recursive function over and over again, causes the browser 
	to send you Maximum call stack size exceeded error message as the memory that can 
	be allocated for your use is not unlimited.	
	
	EXAMPLE:
		(function x() {
  			x();
		})();

    6). TypeError: Cannot read property length:-
	* This error occurs if try to find the length of normal variable of primitive type
	instead of using 'length' function on array or string.

	EXAMPLE:
		var array;
		for(var itr=0;itr<array.length;itr++) {
			console.log(array[itr]);
		}
