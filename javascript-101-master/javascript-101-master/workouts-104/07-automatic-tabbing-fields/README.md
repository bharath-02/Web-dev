## Tasks

Write code that accomplishes the following:

1. The user sees an HTML form, which has three separate fields for parts of a phone number (ex: 402-555-0000).
2. Write JavaScript so that when a user types in enough characters for each of the first two fields, their cursor automatically moves to the next field.
