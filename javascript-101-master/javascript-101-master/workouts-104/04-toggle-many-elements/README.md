# DOM Atomic 04: Toggle Many Elements

This is a combination of the previous two atomics. You will be _either_ hiding or showing elements, based on their current display state.

## Tasks

You have some starter HTML code. Review that and then write code that accomplishes the following:

1. Find all of the elements that you want to toggle.
2. When you click a button, those elements should either be shown or hidden.
3. When you click that button again, those elements should be toggled again.
4. You can repeat as many times as you like--the button always "toggles" the display state of the elements.
