# DOM Atomic 03: Show Many Elements

This is the exact reverse of the previous atomic: Instead of hiding many elements with a shared class, you should show those elements.

## Tasks

Write code that accomplishes the following:

1. When the page loads initially, some elements should be hidden.
  - No JavaScript is needed for this part of the feature.
2. Find all of the elements you chose to hide.
3. When you click a button, those elements should be shown.

There is no starter HTML for you. However, we recommend copy/pasting the HTML from the previous exercise and modifying it to suit this exercise.
